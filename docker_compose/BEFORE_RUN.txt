Before you run docker-compose you need to

Memory used:  2GB of RAM

1) Install docker-compose
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose

2) Run the following commands to store the climmob data outside the docker containers
sudo mkdir /opt/climmob
whoami=$(whoami)
sudo chown $whoami /opt/climmob
mkdir /opt/climmob/celery
mkdir /opt/climmob/log
mkdir /opt/climmob/repository
mkdir /opt/climmob/config
mkdir /opt/climmob/mysql

3) Edit the docker-compose.yml to change:
-The mysql security credentials:
line 8: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: my_secure_password
line 77: MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD: my_secure_password

4) Run docker compose
cd climmob/docker_compose
sudo docker-compose up

Docker will pull the necessary images and run climmob. After all images are pulled and
all services run, you will be able to access climmob at http://localhost:5900/.
From there you can poxy pass it using Apache.
